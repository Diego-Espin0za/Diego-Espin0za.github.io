Hello I am currently a First year Computer Science at CSUF I plan on graduating in 2028.
 
// Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

*Lab 6, Part 1 
I liked this lab a lot because we were able to create one of my favorite card games. This lab made us use a lot of if and else statements which helped me better understand the usage of if statements.

*Lab 7, Part 1 
This was my second favorite lab because this lab could be used with real world applications. This lab required a lot of the logic to be correct which made it challenging to debug. I also enjoyed that we had to determine what street we were talking about by reading the input of the command line.

*Lab 5, Part 1
I enjoyed this simple but challenging lab because we were able to find the area of rectangles with our code. In this lab we used the formula Area = L x W to get the answer for the user. I also liked that I was able to solve math problems using code which would allow us to build calculators.
